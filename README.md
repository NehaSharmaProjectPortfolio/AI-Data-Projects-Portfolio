## [Project 3: Dialogue Summarization from Gen AI LLM Model](https://github.com/NehaSharmaProjectPortfolio/GenAI)
### Project Objective: To study dialogue summarization task using generative AI Pre-Trained LLM Model (FLAN-T5) and impacts of prompt engineering to achieve desired outcomes.
We will explore the impact of input text on the output of the model
Then we will further perform prompt engineering to attempt to achieve the desired summarization against the human labelled benchmark.
Next we perform zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences and observe how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models like FLAN-T5 Model
